# Python OS Simulator

A terminal-based operating system simulator built with **pure Python**.
This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, system simulation, and modular architecture** without relying on external frameworks.

The simulator mimics basic operating system components including **user authentication, file management, process handling, and memory simulation**.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate how a simple operating system manages different subsystems.
Instead of focusing on UI or frameworks, the emphasis is on **core logic, system design, and clean code structure**.

This project was built as a learning exercise to strengthen understanding of:

* Python fundamentals
* OOP design
* Modular programming
* State management
* File-based persistence

Each module is responsible for a specific subsystem of the simulated OS.

## How It Works

When the program starts, users are presented with a login/register interface.
After authentication, the main system menu allows interaction with various simulated OS components.

The simulator uses **file-based storage** to persist data between sessions.

---

## Example Usage

```
====================================
        PYTHON OS
====================================

1. Login
2. Register
3. Exit

Enter choice: 1

Login successful!

Main Menu
1. File System
2. Creat Folder
3. Process Manager
4. Memory Manager
5. View Logs
6. Terminal
7. Logout
```
